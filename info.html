        <h2>Info &amp; Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I only ship within the United States. I will not ship internationally. I take payment through both PayPal and Venmo. A QR code will be sent to you after an order is placed.</li>
            <li>Please note that I have a <strong>$20 minimum purchase policy</strong> due to the costs associated with proper live shipping. If you intend to buy bulk, please notify me ahead of time so I have enough time to procure a suitable-sized box.</li>
            <li>I offer a Live Arrival Guarantee (LAG). Please notify me of any deaths on the day of delivery, within 2 hours of arrival. Message immediately upon opening the package providing an attached photo or video with clear evidence of the deceased. You will be refunded the full cost of the lost animal(s). The cost of shipping and handling is nonrefundable.</li>
            <li>In the unlikely event that your bugs are worse for wear and die a short time after arriving, but not during shipping, I will send replacements as long as clear proof of death is provided within 42 hours of the received date. Large orders may be refunded instead.</li>
            <li>I ship Monday-Wednesday using UPS, FedEx, or USPS depending on the purchase. I generally ship using UPS 2nd Day Air, but will Next Day Air a fragile species. I will also ship overnight upon request. All spiders should be shipped using FedEx, as it is illegal to ship using other carriers.</li>
            <li>I am not responsible for lost packages, or mistakes made by shipping carriers. It is your responsibility to provide me with the correct name and address, I cannot give you a refund if you give me incorrect information.</li>
            <li>In the event of a weather emergency, all planned shipments will be put on hold for the safety of the animals. Shipments will resume when conditions are safe. I will always check your local weather before agreeing to ship. Sometimes I may request a package be held for pickup if it is too hot/cold to ship to your door.</li>
            <li>All bugs sold are Captive Bred or Captive Born. I am a big proponent of retaining captive populations of species to reduce rates of mass collection. <strong>DO NOT RELEASE</strong> any exotic, designer morph, or otherwise non-native animals purchased into the wild.</li>
            <li>While sold oothecae should be fertile, there is no guarantee they will hatch. Do your research, but feel free to ask me for advice. Similarly, all paired adult females should be fertile, but there is no guarantee they will lay.</li>
            <li>I will not sell or ship i1s. i1 Nymphs are fragile, require constant feeding and hydration. It is not recommended to ship them. Oothecae are safer to ship.</li>
            <li>I will not sell the Northern Walking Stick (<i>D. femorata</i>) outside of its native range. I will check your zip code to confirm you are within the appropriate range. In a similar fashion, not every state is roach-friendly. Check your local laws before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Transactions in person will have a value equivalent to that of being sold at an Expo, as there will be no shipping price. Inquire about these prices if you are meeting me in person. I am located in Massachusetts (MA).</li>
            <li>I am willing to collaborate with other breeders. If a pairing is successful, I wish to receive eggs or young in return. If I pair in turn, and it is successful, I will send you eggs or young. Check my <a href="index.html#iso">ISO</a> to see if there are any mates that I’m currently looking for!</li>
            <li>There is always a potential to get extras when you order from me, plus a free sticker and business card is included in every order. If you do not want freebies, you can opt out by telling me.</li>
