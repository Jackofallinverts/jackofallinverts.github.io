        <h2>Info &amp; Policies</h2>
		
	<h3 color="#98e7a6">A Personal Note From JOAI</h3>
	<p align="center">Due to personal time constraints working a full time job alongside side invert breeding, I have decided to limit my amount of orders. My active queue has capped at 5 (orders currently being worked on) and soft queue capped at 10. At a total/max queue of 15, no further orders will be accepted or processed until prior orders have been shipped. This may change in the future as I streamline my process. Orders set to hold retain their place of priority in line. The oldest orders have the most priority (Eg. Order #74 has priority over #81).<br>In the event you can't be added to the queue, you can ask to join a wait list.</p><br> 
   <div class="infoleft">   
	<h3>Shipping Policies</h3>   
	<ul>
    <li>I offer a <strong>Live Arrival Guarantee (LAG)</strong>. In case of any deaths, message immediately upon opening the package with clear proof of death within 2 hours for a replacement or refund. In the event that your bugs arrive worse for wear, send clear proof of their condition. If they pass within 2 days of receipt, you are still eligible for a replacement or refund. The cost of shipping and handling is nonrefundable.</li>
	<li>I only ship within the United States; I will not ship internationally. I take payment through both PayPal and Venmo. A QR code will be sent to you after an order is placed. To place an order, simply <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me.</li>
    <li>I ship Monday-Wednesday using UPS, FedEx, or USPS depending on the purchase. I generally ship using UPS 2nd Day Air, but will overnight fragile species or upon request. All spiders should be shipped using FedEx, as it is illegal to ship using other carriers.</li>
	<li>Orders should be finalized and payed for<!-- the weekend--> before shipping. I ship all orders directly to your door, or to be held for pickup at a facility. I do not ship to PO Boxes.</li>
    <li>Please note that I have a <strong>$20 minimum purchase policy</strong> due to the costs associated with proper live shipping.</li>
	<li>Virtual invoices will be provided with each order. If you would like to receive a paper copy alongside your shipment, please let me know.</li>
	<li>Once an order is placed, <b><i>you will be placed in a queue</i>. This queue has a soft max of 10 and hard of 15, but only 5 will be worked on at any given time.</b> When this queue is full, I will be waiting to fill your order until the prior orders are shipped.</li>
	<li>Each invoice is designated an order number for organization that determines your spot in queue. Older numbers have priority (Eg. Order #74 has priority over #81). Orders set to hold retain their place of priority in line.</li>
	<li>Large order volumes will sometimes delay shipping. Please allow me time process and write invoices; this can take anywhere from 48 to 96h.</li>
	<li>If you intend to buy bulk, please notify me ahead of time so I have enough time to procure a suitable-sized box and make suitable containers.</li>
	<li>If you would like me to hold an individual for you, I can! In the event that I have a limited quanity of an organism, you can place a 30% down payment on your animal to ensure ownership.</li>
    <li>I am not responsible for lost packages, or mistakes made by shipping carriers. It is your responsibility to provide me with the correct name and address.</li>
    <li>In case of poor weather, some planned shipments may be put on hold. Shipments will resume when conditions are safe. I will always check your local weather before agreeing to ship. Sometimes I may request a package be held for pickup if it is too hot/cold to ship to your door.</li>    
    <li>In-person transactions will reflect expo pricing to account for lack of shipping cost. Inquire about these prices if you are meeting me in person. I am located in Massachusetts. I will generally deliver or meet up for local deliveries Wednesday-Friday after 5PM. I can also deliver on weekends if given prior notification. I am willing to coordinate with you!</li>
</ul>

		<h3>Husbandry Policies</h3>  
<ul>
    <li><strong>DO NOT RELEASE ANY EXOTIC, DESIGNER MORPH, OR OTHERWISE NON-NATIVE ANIMALS YOU HAVE PURCHASED INTO THE WILD!</strong> This is destructive to the ecosystem and invasive species have become a problem around the world.</li>
	<li>Many of the species I sell will have corresponding <a href="caresheets.html">caresheets</a>. If a sold species has a caresheet, it will be hyperlinked in their details. Feel free to ask follow-up questions in DMs, or offer me suggestions to improve.</li>
	<li>All bugs sold are Captive Bred or Captive Born. I am a big proponent of retaining captive populations of species to reduce rates of mass collection.</li>
	<li>I will sometimes responsibly collect wild specimens for captive breeding projects, but they will never be listed for sale on my website. Contact me if interested.</li>
    <li>While sold eggs or oothecae should be fertile, there is no guarantee they will hatch. Do your research, but feel free to ask me for advice. Similarly, all paired or gravid females should be fertile, but there is no guarantee they will lay.</li>
    <li>I will not sell or ship i1 mantises. First instar nymphs are fragile and require constant feeding and hydration. It is not recommended to ship them.</li>
	<li>I will also not sell or ship any jumping spider slings younger than i5. From the fifth instar onwards, slings are more durable. Other true spiders such as Lynx or Widows can safely be shipped earlier, at ~i3 or so.</li>
    <li>I will not sell the Northern Walking Stick (<i>D. femorata</i>) outside of its native range. I will check your zip code to confirm you are within the appropriate range. Those with a PPQ 526 permit such as schools, zoos or other research institutions are also valid for purchase so long as documents are provided.</li>
	<li>In a similar fashion, not every state is roach-friendly. Check your local laws before purchasing. Florida specifically has very strict roach laws.</li>
	<li>Living animals grow over time. If you place an order and your chosen individual molts, the price will reflect the new instar. Prices may be subject to change.</li>	
	<li>Updates on animals you have purchased from me are welcome and very appreciated! Please feel free to contact me regarding anything your critters have been up to! I'd love to watch them grow up with you. Part of the joy of this hobby is watching the comminity rear my invert pets.</li>
	<li>I will never ship or sell sick or injured individuals. I try to monitor molt dates to avoid shipping bugs during premolt. If your held creature is in premolt, I will suggest a delay on your shipment or to swap out the individual in question. Contact me immediately if an animal arrives worse for wear after shipping.</li>
    <li>I am willing to collaborate with other breeders. If a pairing is successful, I wish to receive eggs or young in return. If I pair in turn, and it is successful, I will send you eggs or young. Check my <a href="index.html#iso">ISO</a> to see if there are any mates that I’m currently looking for! Please contact me to discuss further collaboration so we may agree upon terms. Typically the one who pairs or owns the female gets dibs on the first ooth/sack to check fertility.</li>
    <li>There is always a potential to get extras when you order from me, especially when ordering multiples. <b><u>If you do not want freebies, you can opt out by telling me.</u></b> In every order is also a hand written note, a sticker and business card. </li>
