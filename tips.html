<h2 id="feedernotes">TIPS & TRICKS: INVERT KEEPER NOTES</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DO NOT FEED YOUR MANTISES RAW/COOKED MEAT, DAIRY, FRUIT, DRIED INSECTS OR INEDIBLE OBJECTS.</strong> Mantises are <u>obligate insectivores</u> and will only eat pre-killed or live insects.</li>
	<li><strong>I do not approve of wild caught food as it carries a risk of parasites, pesticides and illness.</strong> In my opinion, it is not ever worth the risk.</li>
    <li><strong>I recommend offering a varied diet to any animal you care for.&nbsp;</strong>For my own feeders, I use 3 different species of roaches, 2 species of moth, and the occasional larvae. For very young slings or nymphs I use both species of fruit flies. My spiders will have mealworms in dietary rotation as well.</li>
	<li><strong>If you care for over 20+ predatory inverts, I recommend owning a small roach colony.</strong> I also recommend making your own fruit fly cultures if you have plans to breed or own multiple young nymphs or slings.</li>
	<li><strong>I recommend using a ketchup bottle to dispense fruit flies</strong> when feeding many young slings or mantis nymphs. It cuts down on escapees, makes distribution easier, and overall makes the endeavor much faster.</li>
	<li><strong>Put a fruit fly culture in the fridge for 5-7 minutes to slow down the flies.</strong> This should make it easier to dispense them into containers.</li>
	<li><strong>Flies (House or Bottle) are a lovely feeder choice for most predatory inverts</strong>, but I personally dislike them escaping on me. Pupae can be fridged for >1 Month. Feed emerged flies a 1:1 powdered milk and sugar mix alongside water.</li>
	<li><strong>If you hate flies but need flying feeders, buy some waxmoths.</strong> Just remember to keep them warm, fed, and out of the fridge at all times. In comparison to flies, they smell fantastic.</li>
	<li><strong>Certain species/individuals may take to different feeders better.</strong> Personally I have noted that the faster a roach is, the more enticing it is to predators. Dubia roaches can be sedentary and thus unappetizing.</li>
	<li><strong>In the event you have a picky mantis, you may need to try gut feeding.</strong> To do so, rip a feeder in half and expose the white of the guts to your mantis's mouth. After a moment they will realize its food, and will likely grab the prey item.</li>
	<li><strong>Roaches can be kept inside containers with a 1" petroleum jelly rim.</strong> Use this trick against roaches that can climb smooth surfaces. Remember to evenly coat it around the rim of the container!</li>
	<li><strong>Dump Pea Flour into your grain-based cultures to ward off grain mites.</strong> Grain mites can quickly overtake fruit fly cultures, enclosures, and feeder bins. This can be obtained simply by blending split peas into a powder in a blender or food processor until a fine dust is produced.</li>
    <li><strong>I do not recommend using crickets as a feeder.</strong> Crickets purchased from pet stores are often unclean and carry bacteria or other illness due to improper housing and cannibalistic corpse consumption. I do not approve of using them as feeders&nbsp;<strong>unless you breed the crickets yourself and can ensure they’re clean.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>I do not approve of black soldier flies (aka calciworms) as feeders, as they are often fed compost including coffee grounds.</strong> Coffee contains caffeine which is toxic to most invertebrates. There have been several reports of mantises getting sick after consuming them.</li>
	<li><strong>Spiders eat by liquifing the insides of prey while mantises consume prey more like a blender.</strong> Because of this, higher chitin prey items are not recommended for mantises as they may lead to blockages.</li>
	<li><strong>Isopods are not good feeders.</strong> They are low in nutrients and very high in chitin. Avoid using them as CUC in mantis setups as mantises are likely to hunt larger species.</li>
    <li><strong>I do not approve of using mealworms, buffalo worms or spikes/maggots as a long term feeder for mantises.</strong> They are too fatty to be considered a balanced diet on their own. Imagine eating only McDonald's your whole life. If you offer these items, use them sparingly like a treat or use them when in a pinch.&nbsp;
	<ul><li><i>Note: Mealworms are perfectly fine when used long-term for spiders, but I still recommend feeder variation.</i></li></ul>
